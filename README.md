# ImageSearch
Search for scientific images using deep learning for computer vision
- image recommendation
- evaluation of feature extraction algorithms
- user-friendly interface

## Basic steps to run image searches:

- Install dependencies:

- Create experiment folder:
  - *database*: one folder per image class
  - *output*: keep models and visualizations
  - *query*: images used as query to the model
  
- Run main file to open user interface:
  - >> python pycbir.py
